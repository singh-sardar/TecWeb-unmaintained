# Artbit
This was a website developed for a project at the University of Padua during the CS Banchlor. It was developed using xhtml, css3, php, ajax and js.

This website is meant to be collection of digital artworks, everyone can register and upload his own masterpieces sharing them with the world and get popularity. 
This version of the project was published on [this address](http://artbit.altervista.org/#).

**Everything was developed from scratch, no external library was used.**

A second version of the site was developed with the aim of using less js and ajax. It can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/singh-sardar/TecWeb)
